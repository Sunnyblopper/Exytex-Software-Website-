                <h3 class="highlight">HOW MUCH DOES MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT COST?</h3>
                <p>The cost of developing a mobile application depends on the specifics of the theme, the complexity of
                    the functionality, and design features. We create projects on platforms with which you need to take
                    into account the nuances of an individual project. The more clearly, more demandingly, the terms of
                    reference are formulated, the more accurately the team will name the price.

                <h3 class="highlight">HOW LONG IS THE APP PUBLISHED?</h3>
                <p>After the creation of the software is completed, the moment of truth comes - the publication in the
                    store. Publication depends on the peculiarities of moderation on the platforms. The Play Market
                    reviews products faster than the App Store. On average, moderation lasts from several days to
                    several weeks. In this case, the software will already be published.</p>

                <p>It depends on the business plan of the mobile application. Native software development is suitable
                    for business if you know exactly your target audience. If the deadlines are running out, then
                    cross-platform projects are faster.</p>
