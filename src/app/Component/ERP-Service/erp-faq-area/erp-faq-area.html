                        The basis of the system is the creation of a single data warehouse containing all information
                        about the business processes of the enterprise and providing simultaneous access to all
                        employees vested with these powers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The main task of the ERP system is: to integrate a set of financial information, order data, the
                        tasks of accelerating production, reducing inventory, and unifying information about employees.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Each of the above elements has its own life cycle. The ERP system allows you to track the life
                        cycle of each element and optimize it. Its use is especially important for large companies that
                        have merged with others.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As you know, the success of a company is proper management, the key to which is forecasting
                        events. ERP-system helps to obtain prompt and high-quality information.

                    <h3>Features of the development and implementation of ERP systems</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a rule, the development of ERP is carried out according to the modular principle of
                        construction. At the same time, each module is “responsible” for a separate line of business or
                        company activities. In particular, the focus of one module of the ERP system may be the
                        automation of the production process, the other module - the automation of marketing activities.
                        They may cover personnel, finance, quality management, and other areas.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thus, business automation using the opportunities provided by modern ERP systems makes it
                        possible to ensure effective management of even the largest company in all aspects of its
                        activities. At the same time, all modules are combined into a common, integral information
                        system that provides integrated and comprehensive business management.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In general, we can confidently say that business automation through the development and
                        implementation of an ERP system gives good results for the development of the company and quite
                        a tangible financial effect in the future. In addition, they significantly increase the level of
                        business information security. However, the scale of these systems is becoming a major challenge
                        for vendors who develop this kind of software. In connection with this feature of ERP, not every
                        developer can provide the required performance and functionality, it is even more difficult to
                        fully adapt the product to the requirements of the customer and the specifics of his activities.
